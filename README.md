# CytoSIM_MT_Nucleus
Disclaimer: S. Dmitrieff and F. Nédélec were of great support to generate the following code and help with the simulation design.

Comprehensive Code for the analysis of CytoSIM-assisted MT dynamics simulations and data extraction:

-template.cym acts as a generating file to allow CytoSIM software to simulate boundary conditions and vary different parameters (including, geometrical constraintsand object properties).

-Analyze_MT is a custom-made Python script to extract specific information from generated simulations (here distribution of MT plus-ends at the geometrical boundary).
Code can be executed using the CytoSIM-Python dedicated pipeline (see CytoSIM github referred in Methods) in Linux environment.
